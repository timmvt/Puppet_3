# Under manifests/nodes.pp, remove the # signs from the code below or change to reflect the following:

# NOTE: The key entry is left blank instead of being complete with the ssh-keygen value

# ssh_authorized_key { 'art_ssh':
#  user => 'art',
#  type => 'rsa',
#  key  => '',
#}

# FROM THE BOOK:
# The value for key in the example above is an empty string-quoted string(''). This will disable SSH logins for the user. If you have enabled password authentication (which I don't recommend, but you might need it in some situations) then this won't stop the user from logging in using his password. To do this, set as password of a single star (*) in Puppet:

# user { 'art':
#   ensure      => present,
#   comment     => 'Art Vandalay',
#   home        => '/home/art',
#   managehome  => true,
#   password    => '*',
}
