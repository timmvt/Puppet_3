  # LOGGING INTO VAGRANT MACHINE
  # navigate to the folder 'vagrant_puppet_demo_server' under 'puppet_3'
  # type 'vagrant up' and wait for boot
  # cd 'puppet_3_VM.git'
  # type 'vagrant ssh' to use the vagrant machine on the command line

# 2015-02-18 12:38 -> troubleshooting /usr/local/bin/papply
  # The new code (below) freezes the command line
    #
    # #!/bin/sh
    #PUPPETDIR=/home/timm/Documents/puppet_3
    #/usr/bin/puppet apply --modulepath ${PUPPETDIR}/modules
    #${PUPPETDIR}/manifests/site.pp

  # The original code (below) does work
    #sudo puppet apply /home/timm/Documents/puppet_3/manifests/site.pp --modulepath=/home/timm/Documents/puppet_3/modules $*

# 2015-02-18 14:55 -> investigating why papply does not work properly; every time 'papply' is run, only the following messages are generated (disregard the number of seconds as they change each time the 'papply' command is executed)
  # Notice: Compiled catalog for puppetdemo.belkin in environment production in 0.08 seconds
  # Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.09 seconds
  #
  # I am expecting to see the following when working on the cat-pictures directory files
  # Notice: /Stage[main]//Node[demo]/File[/var/www/cat-pictures]/ensure: created
